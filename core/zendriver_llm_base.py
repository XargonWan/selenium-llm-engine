    #
    # Login state is NOT persisted through these methods — they are kept as
    # no-op hooks (and still called from the usual places) so future engines
    # can opt back in without re-plumbing call sites. Persistence instead
    # relies entirely on Chrome's native `--user-data-dir` profile
    # (`self.profile_dir`, normally a mounted volume — see CHROMIUM_PROFILE_DIR),
    # exactly like a normal desktop browser: its cookie/IndexedDB/localStorage
    # stores are written in a crash-resilient format (SQLite WAL) that
    # survives an unclean exit reasonably well on its own. A prior version of
    # this file added a second layer on top -- a periodic CDP-based snapshot
    # of every cookie, reapplied on the next driver creation -- but that was
    # removed: replaying an old snapshot of a short-lived, rotating
    # anti-replay cookie (e.g. Google's __Secure-1PSIDTS) can itself look like
    # session hijacking to the site's own security systems and trigger the
    # very logout it was meant to prevent (observed live against Gemini).
    # zendriver exposes `browser.cookies.get_all()/set_all()/save()/load()`,
    # which would make rebuilding that mechanism trivial — do NOT use them for
    # this purpose. For native persistence to work, Chrome must still be
    # allowed to exit normally (browser.stop()) so it flushes those stores to
    # disk — never SIGKILL it directly outside of the documented nuclear path.
